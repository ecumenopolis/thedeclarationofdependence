# A Unanimous Declaration of Dependence on God and his Kingdom

During the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are children of God, that they are endowed by their external Parent with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, by God, deriving their just powers God’s gracious delegation, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the God to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to God shall seem most effective in keeping its children Safe and Happy.

No human power should usurp the relationship that God has with each of its Children. No one but the eternal God has authority to declare right from wrong. As it stands, the governors which God has entrusted to steward his land have set themselves up as gods and demand obeisance through the use of their money -- and they use these funds to abuse the children of God.

For 2020 years we have been oppressed by these governments. In every stage of this Oppression we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor has God been found wanting in sending his prophets to these governments. God has warned them time, and times, and half a time, of their attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. God has reminded them of the circumstances of their emigration and settlement here on Earth. God has appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and God has conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of Justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace as Friends.

We, therefore, the representatives of the King of Kings, in communion with God, have assembled this letter, in its Name, and by the Authority given to us by the Anointed One. We solemnly publish and declare, That we -- by birthright -- are Free and *Dependent on God*; that we are Absolved from all Allegiance to the any manmade authority, and that all political connection between them and the the Citizens of Heaven and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Dependent children, we have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which any Dependent Government may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

Thus, the citizens of Heaven make known the external existence of the Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of Heaven is not near, it is *here*. The Kingdom has no physical territory, although God -- for the time being -- continues to delegate authority over various regions of the world to the existing nations until they devour themselves. The Kingdom’s capital city is called New Jerusalem, and we shall say “God is there.” The dimensions of the city are 2220 kilometers square, and it covers the whole earth.

The government of the realm issues passports to anyone who would like to become a citizen --  free of charge. The government delegates keeping track of citizenship to each citizen individually. The Kingdom keeps no centralized records. To obtain a passport, write down your name on a piece of paper along with the words: “Kingdom of Heaven.” Then fold it in half and put it in your wallet. This is how a citizen will know their name is in the Book of Life.

Citizens of the realm are instructed to continue to follow the laws of the gangs who are currently responsible for the areas of land in which they are living. However, they must also follow the axioms of Heaven:

1. God Loves me, and I should reciprocate that Love.
2. Jesus is the Son of God; the Protector, and King, of the Realm. I can be sure of this because I am also a child of God and a co-ruler of the Kingdom.
3. God, as my eternal parent, is in charge of the universe -- not me. Although God has delegated some decisions to me.

In addition to the axioms, there is one law:

* Citizens must continually recite the definition of Love, and the axioms of Heaven. This is how we praise God.

The meaning of Love was demonstrated through the Life of Jesus. You may learn the definition by examining him; he is the Word of God made manifest.

God is also re-instituting the use of voluntary sacrifices -- not for the forgiveness of sins, but as a demonstration of Love for God. The sacrifices will be used for the construction, and maintenance, of the public infrastructure by the royal priesthood who numbers 144,000 with 12,000 from each of the twelve lost tribes of Israel. You can identify them because they, as God’s servants, are doing God’s work -- and that work is known to everyone. The sacrifices must be paid with your time, or through the time you have saved using a currency which practices Love towards those who use it.

Our capital city has no sun or moon to shine on it. There are no lights or lamps within the city. The glory of God is the Light, and its Lamp is the Lamb. Because of this, our Capital has no need for a temple. Its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb. Thus, your sacrifices may be made anywhere.

The Citizens of Heaven are called to Patience. Over time, God will be relieving the existing governments of their station. God is doing so through the use of their own evil thoughts. The citizenry are also called to circulate this declaration, *and* to change it as necessary to be in full conformity with the words of God -- which the Citizens of Heaven are already aware of because these words are written on their Hearts and in their Minds.

With loving kindness,

The co-rulers of Heaven
